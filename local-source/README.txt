According to http://www.turnkeylinux.org/benefits "The TurnKey Linux virtual appliance library is licensed under the same terms as Ubuntu. In other words, you are free to download, use, redistribute and modify a virtual appliance for any purpose." and "100% Open Source: free from expensive and restrictive proprietary licensing. Easy to customize and extend to build new appliances from the closest existing starting point."
