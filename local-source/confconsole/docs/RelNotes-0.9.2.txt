====================
v0.9.2 Release Notes
====================

multiple nic support
====================

- auto configuration of default nic used in usage display
  (previously eth0 was hardcoded)

- option to set default nic for display in Usage

    $ cat /etc/confconsole.conf
    default_nic eth0

- if no nics are configured, go directly to nic configuration

- network configuration information displayed inline

- basic customized manual configurations in /etc/network/interfaces
  will be retained (this is a side-effect, not a feature!)

- depends on resolvconf to support different nameservers for
  different nics


many bugfixes and changes, these are just a few
===============================================

- save default route when configuration static ip (#LP:303498)

- catch exceptions generated by 'route -n' (#LP:306928)

- ip address validation

- updated init script to execute confconsole more like a daemon

- stop confconsole before shutdown/reboot (cosmetic)
