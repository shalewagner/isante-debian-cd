====================
v0.9.3 Release Notes
====================

* new configuration variable: CONFCONSOLE_FGVT

    - when executing shutdown, change to vt CONFCONSOLE_FGVT if set
    - fixes "unable to deallocate vt" error, and displays shutdown output

* handle use cases as expected (user experience)

    - only display list of nics when more than 1 are available
    - dont display "this is default nic" if only 1 nic
    - if no nics are configured at all display error and go to advanced
    - dont display cancel button on advanced menu when no nics at all
    - provide user with more descriptive error (no ip or mask provided)
    - dont display 'set as default nic' if interface is not configured yet
    - allow user to remedy mistakes in the staticip configuration screen
    - allow user to delete/unconfigure nameserver/gateway
    - unconfigure the nic if all fields are empty when setting static ip

* updated default button labels to make more sense

    - Globally:        OK -> Select , Cancel -> Back
    - Form (StaticIP): OK -> Apply  , Cancel -> Cancel (due to global)

    - Back button now acts like a back button (rewrote the dialog
      looping code)

* fixed static nameserver configuration to persist across reboots

* intercept exit signal and verify whether to quit (ESC, ALT+?)

* validate all input prior to attempting to apply them (with better ip
  validation)

* template changes

    - added $hostname variable for usage substitution
    - updated webmin default port to 12321
