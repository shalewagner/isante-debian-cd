====================
v0.9.4 Release Notes
====================

* leverage debian networking tools (ifup/ifdown)

    - instead of reinventing (poorly) manipulation of network interface,
      the correct way (and seperation of concerns) is to manipulate
      various configuration files and rely on ifup/ifdown to configure
      the interface.

    - not to mention the hooks that are relied on:
      if-down.d  if-post-down.d  if-pre-up.d  if-up.d

* removed udhcpc dependency and demoted resolvconf to recommends

    - we now rely on ifup to start/stop whatever dhcp client happens to
      be installed.

    - the confconsole works fine without resolvconf, but it is
      recommended when using multiple nics.
      
    - none-the-less, when displaying an interface's nameserver:

        - check if one is set in /etc/network/interfaces (static)
        - check if resolvconf via any dhcp client
        - if not, fallback to /etc/resolv.conf

* handle exceptions in a user friendly way (fault tolerant)

    - errors/bugs are inevitable, we should attempt to minimize their
      impact as much as possible.

    - raising an exception terminates confconsole, and this is
      unfriendly to new users (confconsole suddently crashes).

    - instead, we intercept the exception and provide a useful traceback
      that can be submitted (so we an squash the bug), and finally
      return the user to the previous dialog.

* retain iface options which are already defined when updating
  interfaces configuration

    - provides support for pre/post up and down configurations (flexibility)

    - bugfix: iface options were lost when updating configuration

        - this was originally by design as the user was prompted to
          remove the header if manual changes were made.

        - but we need this functionality to allow other applications to
          update the configuration (e.g., webmin firewall activate on
          boot).

* added support for multiple nameservers. noticable UI changes:

    - minimum of 2 nameserver fields
    - atleast 1 blank nameserver field (which means an infinate amount of
      nameservers can be added)

* moved template to /etc/confconsole/usage.txt and set as conffile

    - it is a configuration file, and can be customized.
    - it should not be automatically replaced when upgrading.

* template changes

    - added web shell with port 12320
    - updated SSH line to display SFTP as well

    - generic dialog changes: increased default height (18 -> 20)

* bugfixes

    - fixed severely broken static IP configuration screen (configuring
      a static IP without a gateway would raise an exception).

    - refuse to run confconsole without root privileges.

    - changed resolvconf interface path

        - ubuntu implemented a workaround to store "run" info in /var/run
        - its better to look in the path it is meant to be (ubuntu
          created a symlink to /var/run)

    - install docs/

* misc

    - added sanity check to set_static.

    - refactored away indecipherable regexp from is_ipaddr.

    - use clean upaddr module to determine if dateway is in IP range,
      and include a more helpful error message if not.

    - standardized enumeration of /etc/network/interfaces information
