REQUIREMENTS
------------
Python 2.2 or newer. 


INSTALLATION
------------

pythondialog is packaged with Distutils (the current standard way to
package Python extensions), so its installation should be as simple as:
  - make this file's directory your shell's current directory
  - optionally edit setup.cfg to make sure that it fits your needs
    (particularly the installation prefix); in the case of the prefix,
    you could alternatively specify it later with the --prefix,
    --exec-prefix, etc. arguments of setup.py---these are described in
    detail in the "Installing Python Modules" chapter of the Python
    documentation.

  - a) 1) type:

            python ./setup.py build

       2) then, as root:

            python ./setup.py install --record /path/to/foo

          where foo is a file of your choice which will contain the list
          of all files installed on your system by the preceding
          command. This will make uninstallation easy (you could ommit
          the "--record /path/to/foo", but uninstallation could not be
          automated, then).

    OR

    b) type, as root:

            python ./setup.py install --record /path/to/foo

       This will automatically build the package before installing it.
       The observations made in a) also apply here.


If this default installation is not what you wish, please read the
Distutils documentation. In Python 2.1 and above, it is included in the
base Python documentation and the chapter you'll need is most probably
"Installing Python Modules".


UNINSTALLATION
--------------

Provided you have followed the instructions given in the installation
section, you have a /path/to/foo file that contains all the files the
installation process put on your system. Great! All you have to do is:

   while read file; do rm -f "$file"; done < /path/to/foo

under a Bourne-compatible shell and with the appropriate privileges
(maybe root, depending on where you installed pythondialog).

Note: this will handle file names with spaces correctly, unlike the
simpler "rm -f $(cat /path/to/foo)".
